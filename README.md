## 📋 Project Overview

SPM Analysis Tools is a comprehensive suite of software project management utilities designed to assist project managers in making informed decisions about project planning, resource allocation, and cost management. The application provides powerful tools for evaluating renewable energy projects, tracking software development productivity, performing PERT analysis, and visualizing project task dependencies.

## ✨ Features

### 🌞 Renewable Energy Project Analysis
- Compare Solar and Wind energy projects based on ROI, NPV, and IRR calculations
- Visualize investment returns over time
- Conduct detailed financial analysis with customizable parameters

### 💻 Software Productivity Analysis
- Track and measure software development productivity across multiple projects
- Compare team performance using key metrics like SLOC per work month
- Identify productivity trends and bottlenecks

### 📊 PERT Analysis
- Calculate task durations using the Program Evaluation and Review Technique
- Determine expected completion times based on optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates
- Calculate variance and standard deviation for better risk assessment

### 🔄 Precedence Network Visualization
- Visualize project task dependencies in a network diagram
- Identify critical paths and dependencies between tasks
- Better understand project structure and workflow
